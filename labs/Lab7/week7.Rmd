Goodness of fit tests:

AIC vs BIC

Log likelihood

Deviance

Chi squared 





Level 1 vs Level 2 predictors
* anything that changes at level 1
* anythiing that changes at level 2
* level 2 are things that are not affecting 
* some variables are both
* 



Functions and packages:

Adding a quadratic effect

triple interaction

all these lower level terms need to be interpreted at the intercept



Refitting your model with ML (instead of REML)

ML vs REML?

Only variables that change over time as random effects


Making it easier for the program to converge, this was discussed



He mentions the collinearity that can be canceled out between say, X and X^2 through centering...remember this does not necessary change your model fit
