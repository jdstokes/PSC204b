**Homework Week 8**

**PSC 204B**

**Part I. Multilevel linear model**

This experiment investigated the effect of diet on the early growth of chicks.

**1.** Load ChickWeight dataset from library(datasets).

**2.** First, explore the data by selecting 10 chicks and plotting weight against Time (hint: could use xyplot().

**3.** Fit a null model and a full model that includes both a random slopes/intercept component and includes time and diet.

**4.** Compare model fits using both anova() and AIC.

**5.** Create a plot showing the predicted weights at each time point for each of the four diets.

**Part II. Generalized linear mixed effects**
